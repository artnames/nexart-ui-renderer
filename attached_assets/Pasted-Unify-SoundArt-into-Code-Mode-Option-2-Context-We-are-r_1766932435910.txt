Unify SoundArt into Code Mode (Option 2)

Context

We are refactoring NexArt so there is no separate SoundArt engine.

Audio-reactive art must be implemented as Code Mode sketches with audio inputs, using the existing deterministic Code Mode runtime.

Sound is data only, never a renderer.

⸻

🎯 Objective

Fully remove the standalone SoundArt rendering engine and make audio-reactive generation a first-class input to Code Mode.

After this change:
	•	There is one rendering engine: Code Mode
	•	Sound analysis produces a snapshot object
	•	That snapshot is injected into Code Mode sketches
	•	All visuals (static or animated) are rendered by Code Mode
	•	Determinism is preserved

⸻

🧱 Target Architecture

Audio Input
   ↓
Sound Analysis (existing logic)
   ↓
Sound Snapshot (pure data, 0–100 normalized)
   ↓
Code Mode Runtime (p5-style, seeded)
   ↓
Deterministic Render (static or animated)

There must be no Canvas2D drawing outside Code Mode.

⸻

🛠️ Required Tasks

1. Remove SoundArt as a rendering engine
	•	Do NOT use Canvas2D drawing functions directly for SoundArt styles
	•	Keep sound analysis logic only
	•	Delete or deprecate SoundArt-specific render loops

⸻

2. Formalize the Sound Snapshot
Create a single snapshot object injected into Code Mode sketches:

sound = {
  volume,
  brightness,
  rhythmicity,
  harmonicity,
  aggression,
  bass,
  mid,
  treble,
  dynamicRange,
  attack,
  length,
  silence,
  hue,
  chroma,
  tNow
}

All values must be normalized (0–100).

⸻

3. Inject sound into Code Mode
Extend Code Mode so sketches can access:

S.volume
S.brightness
S.rhythmicity
S.harmonicity
S.aggression
// etc

This must work in:
	•	Static mode
	•	Animated / looped mode

No sketch should need to know about SoundArt.

⸻

4. Enforce determinism
	•	All randomness must use seeded random() and noise()
	•	No Math.random() or time-based randomness in deterministic mode
	•	Audio snapshot values are deterministic inputs

⸻

5. Convert at least one existing SoundArt style
Convert Flow Grid Rings into:
	•	A pure Code Mode sketch
	•	Driven only by the sound snapshot
	•	No Canvas2D drawing outside the runtime

This serves as the reference implementation.

⸻

🚫 Constraints (Important)
	•	Do NOT introduce a new rendering engine
	•	Do NOT keep SoundArt-specific drawing helpers
	•	Do NOT bypass Code Mode for visuals
	•	Do NOT break existing non-audio Code Mode sketches

⸻

✅ Success Criteria
	•	SoundArt no longer exists as a renderer
	•	Audio-reactive art is just “Code Mode with sound input”
	•	One runtime, one protocol, one SDK path
	•	Deterministic outputs across static + animated renders

⸻

🧠 Design Principle (Non-Negotiable)

NexArt is a generative runtime.
Sound is just another input, like time or seed.

Implement everything accordingly.
