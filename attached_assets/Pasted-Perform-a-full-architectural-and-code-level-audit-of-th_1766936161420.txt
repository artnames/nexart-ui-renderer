Perform a full architectural and code-level audit of the SoundArt mode to verify that it is 100% compliant with the NexArt protocol and exclusively uses the Code Mode engine for rendering.

Context:
SoundArt was previously rendered via a legacy Canvas 2D renderer with soft protocol enforcement.
SoundArt has now been migrated to render through the Code Mode deterministic runtime.
The goal is to fully retire legacy rendering paths and treat SoundArt as a first-class NexArt system generator.

Audit Objectives

You must prove or disprove the following statements with concrete evidence from the codebase:
	1.	Rendering Path
	•	All SoundArt styles render via the Code Mode engine
	•	No active SoundArt style uses a legacy Canvas 2D renderer
	•	No visual output bypasses the NexArt runtime
	2.	System Generation
	•	Each SoundArt style compiles into a valid NexArt system
	•	Audio input is mapped to parameters, not imperative drawing
	•	All drawing uses protocol-approved primitives and Code Mode APIs
	3.	Determinism
	•	Seeded randomness is used consistently
	•	Audio snapshots do not break determinism guarantees
	•	Replaying the same audio + seed yields the same system behavior
	4.	Legacy Code
	•	Identify any remaining legacy SoundArt renderer code paths
	•	Confirm whether they are unused, deprecated, or still active
	•	Recommend deletion or hard deprecation if found
	5.	Render Gate & Routing
	•	Verify that the render gate always routes SoundArt through Code Mode
	•	Ensure no runtime fallbacks silently switch to legacy rendering

Deliverables
	1.	Compliance Report
	•	Bullet-point verification for each objective above
	•	Explicit ✅ / ❌ / ⚠️ status per item
	2.	Code References
	•	File paths and functions proving compliance
	•	Clear identification of any non-compliant code
	3.	Final Verdict
	•	Is SoundArt now fully protocol-native? (Yes / No)
	•	If not, list exactly what must change
	4.	Cleanup Plan (if needed)
	•	Concrete steps to remove remaining legacy paths
	•	Safe migration or deletion instructions

⸻

Constraints
	•	Do not add new features
	•	Do not refactor unrelated code
	•	This is an audit only
	•	Be strict — assume this will be used for protocol documentation

Treat SoundArt as a protocol surface, not a UI feature.
