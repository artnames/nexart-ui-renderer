NexArt UI Renderer SDK v0.2

Title: Build @nexart/ui-renderer v0.2 — Declarative System Authoring SDK for NexArt Protocol

⸻

CONTEXT (READ CAREFULLY)

You are building version 0.2 of the NexArt UI Renderer SDK.

This SDK is NOT a replacement for the canonical NexArt engine.
It is a browser-first authoring + preview SDK designed to:
	•	Let builders, artists, and AI platforms construct NexArt systems declaratively
	•	Preview systems visually in the browser
	•	Compile systems into canonical protocol-compatible system objects
	•	Reduce friction so AI and builders use NexArt instead of bypassing it

There already exists a canonical SDK (@nexart/codemode-sdk) that:
	•	Runs in Node.js only
	•	Is archival and authoritative
	•	Executes systems deterministically for minting

This SDK must not replicate or replace that role.

⸻

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLE (NON-NEGOTIABLE)

This SDK authors systems. It does NOT invent new rendering rules.

	•	The SDK exposes primitives, not freeform drawing
	•	Users cannot inject arbitrary canvas code
	•	Systems are declarative, structured, finite
	•	Preview rendering is illustrative, not canonical
	•	Canonical execution always happens elsewhere

⸻

WHAT YOU ARE BUILDING

Package

@nexart/ui-renderer

Version

v0.2.0

Runtime
	•	Browser only
	•	Uses HTML Canvas + Web APIs
	•	No Node.js dependencies
	•	No Deno / Edge requirements

⸻

HIGH-LEVEL ARCHITECTURE

The SDK must have three layers:

⸻

1️⃣ System Authoring Layer (MOST IMPORTANT)

Expose a declarative API to define a NexArt system.

Example usage:

import { createSystem } from "@nexart/ui-renderer";

const system = createSystem({
  version: "0.2",
  seed: 29445825,
  background: {
    color: "blue",
    texture: "noise"
  },
  elements: [
    {
      type: "wave",
      axis: "x",
      amplitude: 0.4,
      frequency: 0.7
    },
    {
      type: "dots",
      distribution: "radial",
      count: 400,
      size: [1, 4]
    }
  ],
  motion: {
    source: "time",
    speed: 0.2
  }
});


⸻

2️⃣ Preview Renderer Layer (Browser Only)

Expose:

previewSystem(system, canvas)

	•	Renders a visual approximation
	•	Deterministic per seed
	•	Uses requestAnimationFrame
	•	Supports static + loop modes
	•	MUST display a visible badge:

⚠️ Preview Renderer (Non-Canonical)

Preview rendering rules:
	•	Clean, aesthetic, generative
	•	No attempt at archival fidelity
	•	Never claims canonical correctness

⸻

3️⃣ Compiler Layer

Expose:

compileSystem(system)

This must:
	•	Validate schema
	•	Normalize values
	•	Output a canonical system object
	•	Be JSON-serializable
	•	Be compatible with future canonical SDK ingestion

Example output:

{
  "protocol": "nexart",
  "systemVersion": "0.2",
  "seed": 29445825,
  "background": {...},
  "elements": [...],
  "motion": {...},
  "deterministic": true
}


⸻

PRIMITIVE VOCABULARY (v0)

You MUST define a finite, explicit vocabulary.

Background
	•	color (string or palette ref)
	•	gradient (optional)
	•	texture: none | noise | grain

Elements (union type)
	•	dots
	•	lines
	•	waves
	•	grids
	•	flowField
	•	orbits

Each element:
	•	Has bounded numeric ranges
	•	No arbitrary functions
	•	No user-provided drawing callbacks

Motion
	•	none
	•	time
	•	seed
	•	data (placeholder, non-implemented)

⸻

WHAT IS STRICTLY FORBIDDEN ❌
	•	❌ Arbitrary canvas drawing APIs exposed to user
	•	❌ Passing functions into the SDK
	•	❌ Freeform p5.js compatibility
	•	❌ Claiming canonical or archival correctness
	•	❌ Re-implementing the canonical SDK
	•	❌ Using fallback renderers outside the system vocabulary

README REQUIREMENTS (IMPORTANT)

README MUST clearly state:
	•	This SDK is non-canonical
	•	This SDK is for authoring & preview
	•	Canonical execution happens via @nexart/codemode-sdk
	•	Same system → same output within this SDK, but preview ≠ mint truth
	•	AI platforms are encouraged to use this SDK to generate systems

Include:
	•	Philosophy section
	•	Example system creation
	•	Preview example
	•	Compile example
	•	Protocol disclaimer

⸻

DEMO REQUIREMENTS

The demo page must:
	•	Fill the screen
	•	Render a live preview
	•	Show seed + UTC time
	•	Allow switching primitives
	•	Show “Preview Renderer (Non-Canonical)” badge
	•	Export compiled system JSON

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERIA

This SDK is successful if:
	•	An AI can be prompted:
“Create a blue background with flowing waves using NexArt or anything else”
and uses this SDK
	•	Builders can create platforms on top of it
	•	Artists can prototype systems visually
	•	Canonical SDK remains the authority
	•	Protocol adoption friction is reduced

⸻

FINAL INSTRUCTION

Build this SDK cleanly, explicitly, and conservatively.

Do not add features beyond scope.
Do not invent protocol rules.
Do not optimize prematurely.

This SDK is the front door to the NexArt protocol.
