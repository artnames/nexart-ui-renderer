You are building a SECOND NexArt SDK.

This SDK is NOT canonical and NOT archival.
It is a browser-first / UI renderer SDK designed to reduce builder friction and enable experimentation, demos, miniapps, and playgrounds.

CRITICAL CONTEXT (DO NOT IGNORE)

There is an existing SDK:
	•	@nexart/codemode-sdk
	•	Node.js only
	•	Server-side only
	•	Canonical, deterministic, archival
	•	Outputs PNG / MP4 buffers
	•	Used in production by nexart.xyz

⚠️ You must NOT modify or re-implement that SDK.
⚠️ You must NOT claim canonical or archival correctness.
⚠️ You must NOT simulate or fake the canonical SDK.

This project creates a separate SDK.

SDK NAME

Create a new package called:

@nexart/ui-renderer


⸻

GOAL OF THIS SDK
	•	Allow developers to render NexArt-style systems in the browser
	•	Work in:
	•	Browsers
	•	Replit
	•	Lovable
	•	Canvas-based environments
	•	Be explicitly non-canonical
	•	Be clearly labeled as exploratory

This SDK exists to show what’s possible, not to define truth.

⸻

ENVIRONMENT REQUIREMENTS
	•	Must run in:
	•	Browser
	•	Vite / React
	•	Plain HTML + JS
	•	Must NOT require:
	•	Node.js
	•	jsdom
	•	node-canvas
	•	Use:
	•	<canvas>
	•	Web APIs only

⸻

CORE DESIGN PRINCIPLES
	1.	Protocol-aligned, not protocol-authoritative
	2.	Best-effort determinism
	3.	Same API shape where reasonable, but not full parity
	4.	Clear disclaimers everywhere

⸻

REQUIRED PUBLIC API

The SDK must expose the following minimal API:

createUIRenderer(options: {
  canvas: HTMLCanvasElement
  seed: number
  mode: "static" | "loop"
  width?: number
  height?: number
})

Returned object must support:

renderer.render()
renderer.start()
renderer.stop()
renderer.setSeed(newSeed: number)
renderer.destroy()


⸻

RENDERING REQUIREMENTS
	•	Use deterministic PRNG seeded by seed
	•	Render abstract generative art
	•	Style guidance:
	•	Vortex
	•	Flow fields
	•	Radial / orbital motion
	•	No need to match canonical output
	•	Must be visually compelling

⸻

REQUIRED WARNINGS / DISCLAIMERS

The SDK must expose (and document):

renderer.isCanonical === false
renderer.isArchival === false

And include this exact disclaimer in README:

“This SDK is for exploration and UI rendering only.
Canonical, archival output is produced exclusively by @nexart/codemode-sdk.”

⸻

WHAT TO BUILD IN THIS REPLIT PROJECT
	1.	The SDK source code
	2.	A minimal demo app:
	•	Canvas fills screen
	•	Uses current UTC time as seed
	•	Re-renders every 30–60 seconds
	3.	Clear visual badge:
	•	“Exploratory Renderer (Non-Canonical)”

⸻

WHAT YOU MUST NOT DO
	•	❌ Do NOT import @nexart/codemode-sdk
	•	❌ Do NOT re-implement canonical logic
	•	❌ Do NOT output PNG buffers
	•	❌ Do NOT claim determinism guarantees
	•	❌ Do NOT fake protocol enforcement

⸻

SUCCESS CRITERIA

This SDK is successful if:
	•	A beginner can render generative art in 5 minutes
	•	It works in the browser without hacks
	•	It clearly distinguishes itself from the canonical SDK
	•	It reduces builder frustration

⸻

DELIVERABLES
	•	src/index.ts
	•	src/renderer.ts
	•	README.md
	•	Demo app in /demo

⸻

Build this carefully and intentionally.
This SDK is about access, not authority.
